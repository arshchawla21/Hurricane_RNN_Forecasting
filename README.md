# Hurricane Path Forecasting Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

This project explores the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for predicting the paths of hurricanes based on historical data. By using TensorFlow, this model learns from past hurricane trajectories and forecasts future paths, providing insights into hurricane movement trends and helping to improve early warning systems.
